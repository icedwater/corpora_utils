# corpora_utils

This is a collection of tools to wangle corpora into exportable formats like
CSV, and so on. It started with a simple script for generating a CSV file of
collated .txt dialogue transcripts as a .csv, because people Excel when they
are familiar with the software they use.

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.5.2 (will be made more general later on.)
